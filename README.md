## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Cocktail API

This project was built using HTML as the base structure with CSS for the styling. Postman (https://www.postman.com/) was used to test the Pokemon API before it was implemented with the JavaScript. Based on the data obtained from the API, DOM manipulation was carried out to change and display data obtained within the DOM.

The web app provides a form to input a pokemon name and search for that pokemon. The result(s) are then displayed within the DOM. Also, on clicking the search button without any input, it displays random pokemons from the search results and populates the DOM accordingly.

Furthermore, after the pokemon is generated, on clicking any pokemon, a popup is displayed containig more information about the selected pokemon

## Optimizations

A major update required to this web app is to display a notification that tells if a pokemon doesn't exist in the pokemon database. The current state of things is that no result is displayed whatsoever. Also, the code base could be optimised to use OOP as well.

## Lessons Learned:

With this project, my knowledge and command of the use of APIs and async programming became even more solid, as well as with creating new elements and populating the DOM as necessary. Also
